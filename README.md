## 💡 What I Learned
This project was all about React Hooks and state management!
Here are the key takeaways:

**useState**: React’s bread and butter for managing state. 🥪
**useEffect**: Like magic for side effects. ✨
**Passing props** : between components: A React rite of passage. 🎓
**Conditional rendering**: If you know, you know. 😏

## 🦸 About Me
Just a curious developer experimenting with React.
This project is for learning and laughs, so don't expect enterprise-level security. (But hey, the passwords are pretty cool!)
